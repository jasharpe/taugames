Extended-player 500
(<a href="http://www.pagat.com/euchre/500.html">Full 500 Rules</a>)
Add 10 cards per player! Bs, Cs, and 2 Ps first!
When we played this, we used similar rules to 5-player, rather than having set partners.
<!-- note - i thought we did 6-player by only adding 6 cards, so now i am confused? but maybe we also added some double queens. in which case you can't get to 7 this way :( -->

6-player euchre!
Usually, 6-player euchre is played with two teams of three. However, with the Extended Deck, you can play it with three teams of two! Add in two of the blue suits and play as regular euchre!
**still in play testing

5-suit Rummy!
Like Rummy! But with more suits!!
Variation: play with wild cards!

More Better Rummy!
<i>Coming soon -- still in play testing!</i>

INCOMING! (note - name subject to betterment.)
# Players: 2
Deck: all blue suits, all hearts, black joker (69 cards)
Hearts are trump.
Aces low, face cards go J Q K B C P G.
Black Joker reverses the rank, so G of hearts is the lowest card instead of the highest. Trump becomes the first blue suit played. **only for the trick(s) in which the joker is in play**
Deal: one 9-card pile to each player, top card face up, one 10-card hand to each player, secret
Play: Non-dealer leads first trick, after which the trick-winner leads. If no one wins the trick, the previous leader leads again. 
4-card tricks, played alternately.
The face-up cards on the piles ARE IN PLAY, with some special rules. If a face-up card is the winning card for a trick, no one wins that trick.
After each trick, each player picks up their face-up card and turns up the next in the pile.
Play until the hands run out.
Score: points / trick won.
Play until a set score or set number of hands.
