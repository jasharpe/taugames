Extended-player 500
(<a href="http://www.pagat.com/euchre/500.html">Full 500 Rules</a>)
Add 10 cards per player! Bs, Cs, and 2 Ps first!
When we played this, we used similar rules to 5-player, rather than having set partners.
<!-- note - i thought we did 6-player by only adding 6 cards, so now i am confused? but maybe we also added some double queens. in which case you can't get to 7 this way :( -->

6-player euchre!
Usually, 6-player euchre is played with two teams of three. However, with the Extended Deck, you can play it with three teams of two! Add in two of the blue suits and play as regular euchre!
**still in play testing

5-suit Rummy!
Like Rummy! But with more suits!!
Variation: play with wild cards!

More Better Rummy!
<i>Coming soon -- still in play testing!</i>
