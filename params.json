{"name":"Tau Games","tagline":"Tau Games Website and Marketing Materials","body":"This deck contains 9 suits, in 3 colours, with 17 cards per suit. In addition to the 4 ordinary playing card suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs), there are these new suits:\r\n\r\n* Cups (black)\r\n* Shields (red)\r\n* Crowns (blue)\r\n* Bottles (blue)\r\n* Anchors (blue)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary cards in each suit (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace), there are these new face cards:\r\n\r\n* Bishop\r\n* Cardinal\r\n* Pope\r\n* God\r\n\r\nA religious theme was chosen for the additional face cards because in the medieval theme of traditional face cards, it makes sense to have the only things higher than royalty be religion.\r\n\r\nEach face card is marked only with a letter corresponding to its name (i.e. \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", \"B\", \"C\", \"P\", \"G\"), so games are free to interpret these cards as they wish.","google":"UA-63549663-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
